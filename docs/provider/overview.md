Casdoor uses providers to provide third-party services for the platform. In this chapter you will learn how to add providers for Casdoor.

Casdoor will only use providers added by the organization owner when it receives a request from a user in the organization.

Now, we have 3 kinds of providers:

- OAuth providers

  Casdoor allows users to sign in through other OAuth applications. You can add GitHub, Google, QQ and WeChat OAuth applications to Casdoor.

- SMS Providers

  Casdoor sends SMS to users when they want to verify their phone numbers. SMS providers are used to send SMS in Casdoor.

- Email Providers

  Email providers are similar to SMS providers.

And we are going to add OSS providers to Casdoor.
